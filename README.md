## Individal Themes

For those who like bright colors.

First, save the  `themes` directory, as well as the `package.json` and `package.nls.json` files from the following location: c:/Users/your/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft VS Code/resources/app/extensions/theme-defaults to a safe place so that you can restore the original state if needed, or search for the VS Code themes-defaults directory. Once you've saved them securely, delete the originals and replace them with the new files in the specified location.
